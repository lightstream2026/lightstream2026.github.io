## TL;DR
LightStream is a prefetching algorithm designed for short video streams, effectively **minimizing bandwidth waste**.

## Abstract

Short video applications have recently gained tremendous popularity, thanks to the desirable functionalities of home made video sharing and scrollable video switching. To ensure the viewers’ quality of experience (QoE), video prefetching is widely conducted by client-side players. Unfortunately, frequent user swipes lead to the wastage of considerable prefetched data and thus a significant portion of the streaming vendors’ financial costs. The state-of-the-art short video streaming solutions fail to satisfy both data savings for vendors and QoE assurance for users.

To this end, we present LightStream that wisely lightens video streaming without sacrificing the user-perceived QoE. The central concept is to consider both user swipe behavior and network conditions for video prefetching. It is achieved by a fast-convergent hierarchical reinforcement learning model integrated with an expert policy that separately determines the prefetching order and video bitrate, as well as augmented traffic optimization mechanisms. Real-world evaluations demonstrate that our implemented system significantly outperforms the state-of the-art solutions on data wastage and user-perceived QoE across all typical user and network situations.

## Features
LightStream optimizes mobile short video streaming with a user-vendor win-win approach, balancing cost-effectiveness for vendors and Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. Key innovations include:

- **Adaptive Prefetching with HRL**: Integrates user swipe patterns and network conditions using a hierarchical reinforcement learning model for intelligent video prefetching, ensuring efficient data usage while maintaining QoE.
- **Dynamic Bitrate Adjustment**: Adjusts video quality based on network conditions and user behavior, with a policy to conserve data during fast swiping or poor networks, and enhance quality during slow swipes or favorable network conditions.
- **Buffer Management & Download Interruption**: Implements mechanisms to retain video buffers upon app exit and instantly interrupt downloads when videos are swiped away, reducing redundant data transfers and enhancing startup times.

These strategies enable LightStream to tackle the inefficiencies of traditional prefetching, leading to a more sustainable and enjoyable short video streaming experience.
